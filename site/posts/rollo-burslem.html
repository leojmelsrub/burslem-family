While his adoptive father’s name was synonymous with Afghan frontier exploration, Rollo’s history is characterized by a residence within the architectural landmarks of the British establishment and a final decade marked by specialized medical care in a Victorian institution. </p><h2 id="early-life">Early Life and Complex Heritage</h2><p> Rollo was born in Portsea, Hampshire, in August 1843, and baptized on <span property="birthDate">September 10, 1843</span>, at St. Mary’s Church. His early records reveal a unique family dynamic: he was the biological son of Sophia Lee and was later adopted by his stepfather, the decorated Major Rollo Gillespie Burslem. </p><p> His formative years were spent in the rural comfort of East Woodhay, Hampshire. The 1861 Census records him at eighteen years of age living at Hollington, within the agricultural landscape where his father managed a 110-acre farm employing three men. </p><h2 id="marriage-windsor">Marriage and Residence at Windsor Castle</h2><p property="hasOccupation"> In February 1866, Rollo married Temperance Caroline Buther at St. Mary’s in Reading, Berkshire. The union was witnessed by his sister, Flora Sophia Wyatt, and her husband Philip, indicating a close familial bond during this period of his life. </p><p> By 1871, Rollo’s social standing was exemplified by his residence. He was living with his parents in the Salisbury Tower of Windsor Castle, following his father’s appointment as a Military Knight of Windsor. This prestigious setting provided a stark contrast to his later years, placing him at the heart of one of the British Empire's most significant royal landmarks. </p><h2 id="final-years">The British Home for Incurables</h2><p> The final decade of Rollo’s life indicates a significant decline in health. By 1881, census records show he was no longer at Windsor, but was a resident of the British Home for Incurables in Clapham. This institution was founded to provide permanent care for members of the middle classes afflicted by chronic illness or disability that removed them from active professional life. </p><p> Rollo Burslem died on March 15, 1891, within the Wandsworth Home for Incurables at the age of forty-seven. </p><p> His passing preceded that of his father by only five years, documenting a transition from the grandeur of royal towers to the specialized care of a Victorian charitable institution. </p><h2 id="fast-facts">Fast Facts for Historical Reference</h2><table class="fact-table" aria-label="Key milestones of Rollo Burslem"><thead><tr><th>Category</th><th>Detail</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Rollo Burslem</td></tr><tr><td>Birth / Baptism</td><td>1843 / Sep 10, 1843 (Portsea, Hants)</td></tr><tr><td>Death</td><td>March 15, 1891 (Wandsworth, London)</td></tr><tr><td>Residences</td><td>East Woodhay, Hants; Salisbury Tower, Windsor Castle</td></tr><tr><td>Father</td><td>Major Rollo Gillespie Burslem (Adopted)</td></tr><tr><td>Mother</td><td>Sophia Lee (Biological)</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Temperance Caroline Buther (m. 1866)</td></tr><tr><td>Last Residence</td><td>British Home for Incurables</td></tr></tbody></table><section class="related"><h2>Related Burslems</h2><ul><li><a href="/posts/captain-george-james-burslem.html">Captain George James Burslem</a></li><li><a href="/posts/dr-willoughby-marshall-burslem.html">Dr. Willoughby Marshall Burslem</a></li><li><a href="/posts/john-godolphin-burslem.html">John Godolphin Burslem</a></li><li><a href="/posts/major-rollo-gillespie-burslem.html">Rollo Gillespie Burslem</a></li><li><a href="/posts/captain-francis-burslem-rn.html">Captain Francis Burslem</a></li></ul></section></article></div></main></div><footer class="footer">Vibecoded with AI in Portland, OR.</footer><script src="/assets/app.js?v=137"></script></body></html>
