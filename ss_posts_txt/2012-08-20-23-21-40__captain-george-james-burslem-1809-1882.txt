Rank/Regiment: On 1826 he was appointed a Lieutenant, 43rd Regiment of Foot <a href="#4">4</a></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>3. Rank/Regiment: Ensign, 44th Regiment of Foot, 3 Sep 1826, By Exchange. <a href="#5">5</a></p><p>"On the 14th of January, 1826, the regiment proceeded from Fort William to Ghazeepore, where it arrived on the 4th of April, and remained upwards of two years. In October, 1828 , the 44th left Ghazeepore for Cawnpore, which it reached towards the end of November. During the following five years, the head-quarters remained at Cawnpore, but in December, 1833, the regiment marched for Chinsurah. The regiment arrived in Chinsurah in February 1834 and continued there until January, 1835, when it proceeded to Fort William."</p><p>Extract from the Historical Record of the 44th Regiment by Thomas Carter, printed and published by Gale and Polden, Brompton Works, Chatham 1887.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>4. He travelled to Bengal,India on board the ship "Marquis of Wellington" from Gravesend, Kent on 15 Jun 1827 <a href="#6">6</a> He is still shown as a Lieutenant in the 44th Regiment of Foot.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>5. In Jul 1830 he was court martialled.The charge was " With conduct highly disgraceful to, and unbecoming the character of an officer and a gentleman......" . All charges resulted from a card party held at the quarters of Lieutenant Chambers in Cawnpore on the evening of May 29 1829. There were five charges brought in total and Lieutenant Burslem was found not guilty on charges 1,2,4 and 5 but guilty on charge 3. He was sentenced to be severely reprimanded. The subsequent comments of the Commander-in-chief, Lord Dalhousie are of interest " However strongly Lieut. Burslem has, in his Excellency's opinion, evinced in his defence that want of judgement to which he has repeatedly laid claim but the long arrest of Lieut, Burslem prevents the Commander-in-chief, from demanding from another court martial whether the gross vituperations and unwarrantable imputations made by the prisoner on this trial could be considered as to tending to justification or palliation in the court's consideration of the charges before them. The Commander-in-chief does not deem it expedient to enforce the sentence of the court." <a href="#7">7</a></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>6.

In Apr 1857 he lived Mortimer Street, Cavendish Square with his wife and family in London, England <a href="#18">18</a></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>19. In 1861-1871 There is no mention of George James Burslem in either the 1861 or 1871 census. <a href="#19">19</a></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>20. Before 1863 he lived 17 Adelaide road, in Haverstock hill, Middlesex <a href="#20">20</a></p><p>The London Gazette states that he also resided at "Erith, Kent, previously of 64 Edgeware road, Middlesex and formerly of Plymouth, Devon and Portsmouth, Hants."</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>21.

The deed conveyed all his estate and effects to the Trustee to be applied and administered for the benefit of the debtor's creditors, as in bankruptcy.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>23.

He was involved in a court case for bankruptcy on 25 Nov 1863. <a href="#24">24</a></p><p>On November 23 1863 he was ordered to surrender to the Court.</p><p>The following report appeared in the London Daily News on November 24, 1863</p><p>RE CAPTAIN BURSLEM - APPLICATION FOR RELEASE</p><p>This was an adjourned application for release from custody in the matter of George James Burslem, described as a gentleman, of Great James-street, Bedford-row. The case was recently before the court on a question arising out of a deed of arrangement which had been executed by Captain Burslem. He has since been made bankrupt on his own petition. Mr. Sargood supported; Mr. Bagley and Mr. E. Reed opposed. The registrar pointed out to the court that the "three days statement" which ought to accompany every bankrupt's petition, had not been filed, though the petition had presented on the 17th. His Honour said the only course was to dismiss the petition. Mr. Sargood, on behalf of the bankrupt, intimated that a fresh petition would be filed. Mr. Bagley said this was the third time that the creditors had been brought here in the last fortnight; and he asked that the bankrupt should not be allowed to present another petition without giving security for the costs of the creditors. His Honour said the petition being dismissed was no longer a bankrupt, and he could make no order in the case. If the creditors wished it they may have a rule calling on him to show cause why he should not pay the costs of the creditors on this occasion. Mr. Reed also claimed costs on behalf of the creditors he represented. His Honour said if it could be shown that debtors brought their creditors here needlessly and vexatiously, he should be quite disposed to give costs against them; but he feared such an order would be very little use in this case, where the debtor was a pauper. Ex nihile nihil fit. However they might take a rule.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>25. On 30 Nov 1863 he was involved in a court case for bankruptcy in London. <a href="#25">25</a> The Times of London reported:</p><p>" The bankrupt, George James Burslem", of 29 Great James Street, Bedford Row, and elsewhere, gentleman, renewed an application for a release from custody. The debts are between £4,000 and £5,000, with assets doubtful.</p><p>Mr. Bagley on behalf of Messrs Watherston and Brogden, jewellers of Covent Garden asked the Court not to release the bankrupt until after the meeting for the choice of assignees. The learned counsel stated that in June 1861, the bankrupt purchased from his clients a valuable gold watch and chain. The price of these articles was to have been paid in cash; but on application at the bankrupt's residence no money could be obtained, and the bankrupt soon afterwards disappeared. For a long period the bankrupt's whereabouts could not be ascertained, but ultimately he was discovered to be resident at Erith, near Gravesend, and upon being sued by Messrs Watherston and Co. he pleaded "never indebted" and put that firm to an unecessary expense of £20. His HONOUR declined to release the bankrupt until a creditor's assignee had been chosen."</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>26. He was involved in a court case for bankruptcy on 27 May 1874. <a href="#26">26</a></p><p>The Court granted his discharge on this date.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>27.

He was not prosecuted because of his death in December 1882.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>30.
